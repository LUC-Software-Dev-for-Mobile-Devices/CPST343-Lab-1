# Lab 1 - Creating your first .NET MAUI application
Our first lab can be found at the link below.

The link below will direct you to the Microsoft .NET Maui Installation Web Page.  Proceed to completing the installation instructions and once you have everything installed, then proceed to the "Build your first app" link to complete the 9 steps
1.  Make sure to select Visual Studio Code tab and follow proceeding instructions. Previous years, we used Visual Studio IDE and not Visual Studio Code, but Visual Studio required to much compute power along with running Zoom and the emulator.  Also, Visual Studio IDE is being discontinued for Mac users. This year, we'll opt for the VS code editor.
2.  Decide on which platform you will like to build for - IOS or Andriod. Based on the platform you select, you will be assigned to that team for our class.  If you have a Windows computer, I would encourage you to build an Andriod.  If you have a Mac OS, I would suggest you build an IOS app.
